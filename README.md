# Guess The Word

This is a simple game created using React JS, in this project I tried to use just native react modules, 
we could upgrade this project using new libs, but for knowledge purposes and practice  I kept this way.

## Screens
The game start in an initial page where you should click in the button to start the game:

When the game starts you need to choose some words and then click in Send to verify if you choose the correct word, <b>you have only 3 guesses!</b>

When you miss all the 10 chances, you'll be redirected to GameOver page, where you can see you score, and try the game again!
